<h2>Longitudinal classroom friendship network and behavior (Andrea Knecht)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Knecht dataset contains the friendship network of 26 pupils in 
a Dutch school class measured at four time points along with 
several demographic and behavioral covariates like age, sex, 
ethnicity, religion, delinquency, alcohol consumption, primary 
school co-attendance, and school advice. Some of these covariates 
are constant while others vary over time.
</p>
<p>The full dataset (see Knecht 2006 and 2008) contains a large number 
of classrooms while the dataset presented here is an excerpt based 
on one single classroom. This excerpt was first used in a tutorial 
for the software <span class="pkg">Siena</span> and the corresponding R package 
<span class="pkg">RSiena</span> (Snijders, Steglich and van de Bunt 2010). The 
following description was largely copied from the original data 
description provided on the homepage of the <span class="pkg">Siena</span> project 
(see below for the URL).
</p>
<p>The data were collected between September 2003 and June 2004 by 
Andrea Knecht, supervised by Chris Baerveldt, at the Department 
of Sociology of the University of Utrecht (NL). The entire study 
is reported in Knecht (2008). The project was funded by the 
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO, grant 
401-01-554. The 26 students were followed over their first year at 
secondary school during which friendship networks as well as other 
data were assessed at four time points at intervals of three 
months. There were 17 girls and 9 boys in the class, aged 11–13 
at the beginning of the school year. Network data were assessed by 
asking students to indicate up to twelve classmates which they 
considered good friends. Delinquency is defined as a rounded 
average over four types of minor delinquency (stealing, vandalism, 
graffiti, and fighting), measured in each of the four waves of 
data collection. The five-point scale ranged from ‘never’ to 'more 
than 10 times', and the distribution is highly skewed. In a range 
of 1–5, the mode was 1 at all four waves, the average rose over 
time from 1.4 to 2.0, and the value 5 was never observed.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(knecht)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Note: the data have to be transformed before they can be used 
with btergm and related packages (see examples below).
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>friendship</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of adjacency matrices at four 
time points, containing friendship nominations of the column node 
by the row node. The following values are used: <code>0</code> = no, 
<code>1</code> = yes, <code>NA</code> = missing, <code>10</code> = not a member of 
the classroom (structural zero).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>demographics</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with 26 rows (the 
pupils) and four demographic variables about the pupils:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>sex</code> (<code>1</code> = girl, <code>2</code> = boy)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>age</code> (in years)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ethnicity</code> (<code>1</code> = Dutch, <code>2</code> = other, 
<code>0</code> = missing)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>religion</code> (<code>1</code> = Christian, <code>2</code> = 
non-religious, <code>3</code> = non-Christian religion, <code>0</code> = 
missing)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt><code>primary</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a 26 x 26 matrix indicating whether two pupils 
attended the same primary school. <code>0</code> = no, <code>1</code> = yes.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>delinquency</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with 26 rows (the pupils) 
and four columns (the four time steps). It contains the rounded 
average of four items (stealing, vandalizing, fighting, graffiti). 
Categories: frequency over last three months, <code>1</code> = never, 
<code>2</code> = once, <code>3</code> = 2–4 times, <code>4</code> = 5–10 times, 
<code>5</code> = more than 10 times; <code>0</code> = missing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>alcohol</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with 26 rows (the pupils) 
and 3 columns (waves 2, 3, and 4). It contains data on alcohol use 
(“How often did you drink alcohol with friends in the last 
three months?”). Categories: <code>1</code> = never, <code>2</code> = once, 
<code>3</code> = 2–4 times, <code>4</code> = 5–10 times, <code>5</code> = more 
than 10 times; <code>0</code> = missing.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>advice</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a data frame with one variable, “school 
advice”, the assessment given at the end of primary school about 
the school capabilities of the pupil (<code>4</code> = low, <code>8</code> = 
high, <code>0</code> = missing)</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The data were gathered by Andrea Knecht, as part of her PhD 
research, building on methods developed by Chris Baerveldt, 
initiator and supervisor of the project. The project is funded by 
the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO, grant 
401-01-554, and is part of the research program “Dynamics 
of Networks and Behavior” with principle investigator Tom A. B. 
Snijders.
