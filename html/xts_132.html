<h2>Convert time series data to an OHLC series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert an OHLC or univariate object to a specified periodicity lower than
the given data object. For example, convert a daily series to a monthly
series, or a monthly series to a yearly one, or a one minute series to an
hourly series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">to.period(
  x,
  period = "months",
  k = 1,
  indexAt = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  OHLC = TRUE,
  ...
)

to.minutes(x, k, name, ...)

to.minutes3(x, name, ...)

to.minutes5(x, name, ...)

to.minutes10(x, name, ...)

to.minutes15(x, name, ...)

to.minutes30(x, name, ...)

to.hourly(x, name, ...)

to.daily(x, drop.time = TRUE, name, ...)

to.weekly(x, drop.time = TRUE, name, ...)

to.monthly(x, indexAt = "yearmon", drop.time = TRUE, name, ...)

to.quarterly(x, indexAt = "yearqtr", drop.time = TRUE, name, ...)

to.yearly(x, drop.time = TRUE, name, ...)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The result will contain the open and close for the given period, as well as
the maximum and minimum over the new period, reflected in the new high and
low, respectively. Aggregate volume will also be calculated if applicable.
</p>
<p>An easy and reliable way to convert one periodicity of data into any new
periodicity. It is important to note that all dates will be aligned to the
<em>end</em> of each period by default - with the exception of <code>to.monthly()</code> and
<code>to.quarterly()</code>, which use the <span class="pkg">zoo</span> package's yearmon and
yearqtr classes, respectively.
</p>
<p>Valid period character strings include: <code>"seconds"</code>, <code>"minutes"</code>, <code>"hours"</code>,
<code>"days"</code>, <code>"weeks"</code>, <code>"months"</code>, <code>"quarters"</code>, and <code>"years"</code>. These are
calculated internally via <code>endpoints()</code>. See that function's help page for
further details.
</p>
<p>To adjust the final indexing style, it is possible to set <code>indexAt</code> to one
of the following: ‘yearmon’, ‘yearqtr’, ‘firstof’,
‘lastof’, ‘startof’, or ‘endof’. The final index will
then be <code>yearmon</code>, <code>yearqtr</code>, the first time of the period, the last time
of the period, the starting time in the data for that period, or the ending
time in the data for that period, respectively.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to pass a single time series, such as a univariate
exchange rate, and return an OHLC object of lower frequency - e.g. the
weekly OHLC of the daily series.
</p>
<p>Setting <code>drop.time = TRUE</code> (the default) will convert a series that includes
a time component into one with just a date index, since the time component
is often of little value in lower frequency series.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of the original type, with new periodicity.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>In order for this function to work properly on OHLC data, it is
necessary that the Open, High, Low and Close columns be names as such;
including the first letter capitalized and the full spelling found.
Internally a call is made to reorder the data into the correct column order,
and then a verification step to make sure that this ordering and naming has
succeeded. All other data formats must be aggregated with functions such as
<code>aggregate()</code> and <code>period.apply()</code>.
</p>
<p>This method should work on almost all time-series-like objects. Including
‘timeSeries’, ‘zoo’, ‘ts’, and ‘irts’. It is
even likely to work well for other data structures - including
‘data.frames’ and ‘matrix’ objects.
</p>
<p>Internally a call to <code>as.xts()</code> converts the original <code>x</code> into the
universal xts format, and then re-converts back to the original type.
</p>
<p>A special note with respect to ‘ts’ objects. As these are strictly
regular they may include <code>NA</code> values. These are removed before aggregation,
though replaced before returning the result. This inevitably leads to many
additional <code>NA</code> values in the result. Consider using an xts object or
converting to xts using <code>as.xts()</code>.
