<h2>A Structure for Interfaces from R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The XR package defines classes and functions that will be extended and used by interfaces from R to
other languages.
The goals are: a uniform approach; simplicity in programming; users of application packages should be
essentially unaware that particular functions and objects are in fact proxies for computations in
other languages.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions in this package will nearly always be used by other packages, providing an interface to a
particular language (see packages XRPython and XRJulia for examples).  Users will rarely need to call
functions in XR and application packages will rarely need to import it directly.
</p>
<p>For further details, see the reference [1] (Chapter 13 is included in the documentation for this package).
