<h2>Execute a Setup Step for a Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The R code in one or more files is evaluated to carry out setup computations that will
write some code, documentation or anything else into the source directory of an R package.
Designed for package authors who want to use techniques such as the proxy classes in the
XR set of interfaces, <code>compileAttributes()</code> in Rcpp or inline documentation in roxygen2.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">packageSetup(file = "setup.R", dir = ".", needPackage = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>The name of the files to be parsed and evaluated for the setup step,  by default,
<code>"setup.R"</code>.  Will look in the the current directory or the inst/tools directory
for a file of this name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional directory to use as the working directory for the evaluation. By default
the current working directory should be the source directory for the package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>needPackage</code></td>
<td>
<p>The package for which the setup is intended.  Not needed if the working
directory (either currently or given by <code>dir</code> is the source directory for that package.
If supplied can be either the package name or <code>FALSE</code> if the setup is not intended for
a package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The computations will be carried out in an environment constructed by<code>packageSetup()</code>
with the namespace of the package as its parent, and a <code>.packageName</code> object to
associate it with the package.  By default, the setup step looks for the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file in the
working directory to find the package name.  The package must have been installed in the
library path of this R session.
