<h2>Longitudinal international defense alliance network, 1981–2000</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The alliances dataset contains the international defense alliance
network among 164 countries, covering the years 1981–2000. In addition
to the yearly defense alliance network, it contains data on military
capabilities, governing regime type, geographic contiguity and
international conflict. This is an excerpt from a dataset that has
been used in two published analyses. The full dataset (Cranmer,
Desmarais and Menninga 2012; Cranmer, Desmarais and Kirlkand 2012)
contains a large number of countries and a much longer time series.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("alliances")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>allyNet</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of network objects at 20 time points, 1981–2000, containing undirected defense alliance networks. In addition to the alliance ties, each network object contains three vertex attributes. <code>cinc</code> is the "CINC" or Composite Index of National Capability score (see <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities">https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities</a>). <code>polity</code> is the "polity score" of each country in the respective year. Quoting the online description, "the Polity Score captures this regime authority spectrum on a 21-point scale ranging from -10 (hereditary monarchy) to +10 (consolidated democracy)," (see <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html">http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html</a>). <code>year</code> is simply the year recorded as a vertex attribute.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>contigMat</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a 164 x 164 binary matrix in which a 1 indicates that two countries share a border.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>lNet</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of 20 matrices. Each element is the adjacency matrix from the previous year. This is used to model memory in the ties.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>LSP</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of 20 matrices. Each element is a matrix recording the number of shared partners between countries in the alliance network from the previous year.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>warNet</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>is a list of 20 matrices. Each element is a binary matrix that indicates whether two states were in a militarized interstate dispute in the respective year.</p>
</dd>
