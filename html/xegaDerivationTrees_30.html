<h2>Package xegaDerivationTrees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Derivation Trees
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The implementation of a data type for derivation trees.
</p>
<p>The derivation tree operations for generating complete random subtrees and for
for subtree extraction and insertion are formally introduced in Geyer-Schulz (1997)
and used for implementing mutation and crossover operations. 
</p>
<p>Efficient selection of random subtrees is implemented by building a list of annotated 
tree nodes by a left-right depth-first tree traversal. For each node, the R-index 
to access the subtree is built and stored in the node. The R-index element of a node 
allows subtree extraction and insertion operations with the cost of the R-index operation.  
In addition, filtering operations the node list by different criteria (min depth, max depth, and 
non-terminal symbol type) allow the implementation of flexible and
configurable crossover and mutation operations.

<h3>The Architecture of the xegaX-Packages</h3>

<p>The xegaX-packages are a family of R-packages which implement 
eXtended Evolutionary and Genetic Algorithms (xega).  
The architecture has 3 layers, 
namely the user interface layer,
the population layer, and the gene layer: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The user interface layer (package <code>xega</code>) 
provides a function call interface and configuration support
for several algorithms: genetic algorithms (sga), 
permutation-based genetic algorithms (sgPerm), 
derivation-free algorithms as e.g. differential evolution (sgde), 
grammar-based genetic programming (sgp) and grammatical evolution
(sge). 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The population layer (package <code>xegaPopulation</code>) contains
population-related functionality as well as support for 
adaptive mechanisms which depend on population statistics. 
In addition, support for parallel evaluation of genes is implemented here.
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>The gene layer is split in a representation-independent and 
a representation-dependent part:
</p>

<ol>
<li> 
<p>The representation-indendent part (package <code>xegaSelectGene</code>)
is responsible for variants of selection operators, evaluation 
strategies for genes, as well as profiling and timing capabilities.        
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>The representation-dependent part consists of the following packages: 
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>xegaGaGene</code> for binary-coded genetic algorithms.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xegaPermGene</code> for permutation-based genetic algorithms.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xegaDfGene</code> for derivation-free algorithms. For example, 
differential evolution.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xegaGpGene</code> for grammar-based genetic algorithms.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>xegaGeGene</code> for grammatical evolution algorithms.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The packages <code>xegaDerivationTrees</code> and <code>xegaBNF</code> support
the last two packages:
<code>xegaBNF</code> essentially provides a grammar compiler, and 
<code>xegaDerivationTrees</code> an abstract data type for derivation trees.
</p>

</ol>

</ul>
